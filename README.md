# Javascript_Game_ever
It is the first game I have made in Javascript. Now I am trying to improve it, and add some features. If you have any creative ideas, don't hesitate to reach out to me :)

The problem is: There is a bunny image. But it couldn't be seen in Github page. However in my VS code there is visible. PLEASE, HELP ME!
